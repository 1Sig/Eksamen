# API - LOGIN DEMO
This repositary contains basic code for demonstrational purposes. It contains some routes that require authentication, and some that require authorization. 
It requires access to a mongo database, but should be easy enought to reconfigure for other dbs.

## Apropos .env
- DBURI must have a value directing it to a mongo database
- JWTSECRET must have a value. Any value will do; security is your concern
